# self_learning_note
write down my learning note.


+ When I first joined in a project. I found that what I didn't know were still a lot.
+ To finish my job, I still need to learn a lot by myself on the Internet.
+ In order to improve my working efficience, I decided to write some simple learning notes and push them on the github for my simple reference in the future.
+ Most of these notes are concluded by myself, while some of them are others' hard work. I push them with their writers' agreement.
